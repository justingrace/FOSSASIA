# UNESCO - FOSSASIA Hackathon

This is the frontend code for the app 'Gadong'! Social game for Khmu speakers that generates English-Khmu translations. These are not provided on Goodle Transalte since Khmu is an indigenous language and hence this fun way of obtaining translations from a mass of khmu speakers was the app we built for the hackathon.
